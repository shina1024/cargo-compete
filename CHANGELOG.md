# Changelog

## [0.10.7] - 2024-06-08Z

### Changed

- For ABC cargo-compete no longer extract time limits and the relative/absolute errors, because they are not "specific integers or strings". ([qryxip/snowchains#164](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/164))

## [0.10.6] - 2023-08-13Z

### Changed

- Reworked the `submit` configuration. ([#205](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/205))

    `submit.transpile` still works but is deprecated.

    ```toml
    [submit]
    kind = "file"
    path = "{{ src_path }}"
    language_id = "5054" # Atcoder 202301
    ```

    ```toml
    [submit]
    kind = "command"
    args = ["cargo", "+1.70.0", "equip", "--exclude-atcoder-202301-crates", "--remove", "docs", "--minify", "libs", "--bin", "{{ bin_name }}"]
    language_id = "5054" # Atcoder 202301
    ```

    Now the default of `submit` is:

    ```toml
    [submit]
    kind = "file"
    path = "{{ src_path }}"
    language_id = "4050" # AtCoder 202004
    ```

    For today's [AGC064](https://atcoder.jp/contests/agc064), you have to:

    - Update compete.toml:
        - `template.new.edition`
        - `template.new.dependencies`
        - `test.toolchain`
        - `submit` (as above. note that you also have to write `language_id = "5054"`)
    - Update template-cargo-lock.toml

    before `cargo compete new`.

    Refer to [rust-lang-ja/atcoder-proposal@`202301-update-2023-07-17-freeze`](https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/atcoder-proposal/tree/202301-update-2023-07-17-freeze). This repository should be used in the real AtCoder judge system.

## [0.10.5] - 2023-08-12Z

    ```

    [dtolnay/serde-yaml@`6b83603`](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/commit/6b836037b58ebb359e7c485fc6002b1e8214bd6c)

### Fixed

- Updated Rust edition, Rust version, and the language ID for Codeforces. ([#181](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/issues/181) by [@nebocco](https://github.com/nebocco))

## [0.10.1] - 2021-12-09Z

### Fixed

- Fixed a problem where [`timeLimit`](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/api-client#format) is not read when using `oj-api`. ([#178](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/178) by [@SGThr7](https://github.com/SGThr7))

## [0.10.0] - 2021-11-06Z

### Added

- Added `template.new.edition` field. ([#175](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/issues/175))

    ```toml
    # `edition` for `Cargo.toml`.
    edition = "2018"
    ```

- Added `test.toolchain` field. ([#173](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/issues/173))

    ```toml
    # Toolchain for the test. (optional)
    toolchain = "1.42.0"
    ```

### Changed

- `cargo compete init` no longer generate `rust-toolchain`s. ([#173](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/issues/173))

### Fixed

- Updated the Rust versions for `cargo compete init`. ([#175](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/issues/175))

- Inserts a newline between `bin` and `dependencies`. ([#175](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/issues/175))

    ```diff
     [[bin]]
     name = "practice-b"
     path = "src/bin/b.rs"
    +
     [dependencies]
    ```

## [0.9.1] - 2021-09-21Z

### Fixed

- When using `oj-api`, prioritize `alphabet`s from `get-contest` over ones from `get-problem`. ([#166](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/166) by [@bouzuya](https://github.com/bouzuya))

    Now you can use cargo-compete for [AtCoder Problems](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder/#/contest/recent).

## [0.9.0] - 2021-03-31Z

### Added

- Added `template.new.dev-dependencies`. ([#152](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/152))

    ```toml
    profile = '''
    [dev]
    opt-level = 3
    '''
    [template.new]
    dependencies = '''
    proconio = "0.3.7"
    '''
    dev-dependencies = '''
    atcoder-202004-lock = { git = "https://github.com/qryxip/atcoder-202004-lock" }
    '''
    ```

- Enabled running for `example` targets. ([#157](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/157))

    ```toml
    [package.metadata.cargo-compete.example]
    atcoder-abc188-a = { problem = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc188/tasks/abc188_a" }
    ```

- Added `add.target-kind` configuration. ([#157](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/157))

### Changed

- Modified the template for the `init` command. ([#156](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/156))

    ```diff
     #[submit.transpile]
     #kind = "command"
    -#args = ["cargo", "equip", "--resolve-cfgs", "--remove", "docs", "--minify", "libs", "--rustfmt", "--check", "--bin", "{{ bin_name }}"]
    +#args = ["cargo", "equip", "--exclude-atcoder-crates", "--resolve-cfgs", "--remove", "docs", "--minify", "libs", "--rustfmt", "--check", "--bin", "{{ bin_name }}"]
     ##language_id = ""
    ```

- Updated `rust-toolchain`s for Codeforces and yukicoder. ([#153](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/153))

- Now `download` command requires `--overwrite` flag to overwrite existing test files. ([#158](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/158))

    ```console
    ❯ cargo compete d
    error: `/home/ryo/src/local/competitive/atcoder/arc115/testcases/a.yml` already exists. run with `--overwrite` to overwrite
    ❯ cargo compete d --overwrite
           Saved 2 test cases to /home/ryo/src/local/competitive/atcoder/arc115/testcases/{a.yml, a/}
           Saved 2 test cases to /home/ryo/src/local/competitive/atcoder/arc115/testcases/{b.yml, b/}
           Saved 1 test case to /home/ryo/src/local/competitive/atcoder/arc115/testcases/{c.yml, c/}
           Saved 2 test cases to /home/ryo/src/local/competitive/atcoder/arc115/testcases/{d.yml, d/}
           Saved 2 test cases to /home/ryo/src/local/competitive/atcoder/arc115/testcases/{e.yml, e/}
           Saved 5 test cases to /home/ryo/src/local/competitive/atcoder/arc115/testcases/{f.yml, f/}
    ```

## [0.8.8] - 2021-03-10Z

### Added

- [Added `SplitWhitespace` variant to `Match`](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete#matchsplitwhitespace--splitwhitespace). ([qryxip/snowchains#136](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/136))

- cargo-compete now warns when the expected output and the actual one are not matched and whitespace-separated words do. ([qryxip/snowchains#137](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/137))

    ```console
    2/2 ("sample2") Wrong Answer (0 ms)
    stdin:
    3 3
    3 3 3
    expected:
    EMPTY
    actual:

    note:
    whitespace-separated words matched. try setting `match` to `SplitWhitespace`
    error: 1/2 tests failed
    ```

## [0.8.7] - 2021-02-26Z

### Changed

- Made `Extend::SystemTestCases.problem` optional. ([#qryxip/snowchains#133](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/133), [#141](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/141))

    ```diff
     extend:
       - type: SystemTestCases
    -    problem: https://atcoder.jp/contests/agc001/tasks/agc001_a
    ```

### Fixed

- Fixed around <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>. ([#qryxip/snowchains#135](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/135))

## [0.8.6] - 2021-02-25Z

### Added

- Added [`SystemTestCases` variant](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete#extendsystemtestcases) to `extend` in test suite files. ([qryxip/snowchains#131](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/131), [#138](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/138))

    System test cases are stored under <code>[{ cache directory }](https://docs.rs/dirs-next/2/dirs_next/fn.cache_dir.html)/cargo-compete/system-test-cases</code>.
    They are automatically downloaded if missing when `test`ing code.

    ```yaml
    extend:
      - type: SystemTestCases
        problem: "https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc191/tasks/abc191_a"
    ```

### Changed

- `cargo compete test` command without `--full` option will append `{ type: Text, ... }` to `extend` and will create empty `in` and `out` directories. ([#138](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/138))

    ```console
    ❯ cargo compete n arc110 --problems a
        Created `arc110` package at /home/ryo/src/competitive/atcoder/./arc110
        Saved 2 test cases to /home/ryo/src/competitive/atcoder/./arc110/testcases/{a.yml, a/}
    ❯ tree ./arc110/testcases
    ./arc110/testcases
    ├── a
    │   ├── in
    │   └── out
    └── a.yml

    3 directories, 1 file
    ```

    ```yaml
    ---
    type: Batch
    timelimit: 2s
    match: Lines

    cases:
      - name: sample1
        in: |
          3
        out: |
          7
      - name: sample2
        in: |
          10
        out: |
          39916801

    extend:
      - type: Text
        path: "./a"
        in: /in/*.txt
        out: /out/*.txt
    ```

- `SystemTestCases` will be used for `--full` option. ([#138](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/138))

### Fixed

- Fixed a problem where `cargo compete download` command saves nothing. ([#139](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/139))

## [0.8.5] - 2021-02-23Z

### Fixed

- Fixed [a problem where processes are not killed for timeout](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/issues/135). ([qryxip/snowchains#129](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/129))

## [0.8.4] - 2021-02-19Z

### Added

- Added `template` field to `compete.toml`.

    ```toml
    [template]
    src = '''
    fn main() {
        todo!();
    }
    '''

    [template.new]
    profile = '''
    [dev]
    opt-level = 3
    '''
    dependencies = '''
    proconio = { version = "=0.3.6", features = ["derive"] }
    # ...
    '''

    [template.new.copy-files]
    "./template-cargo-lock.toml" = "Cargo.lock"
    ```

- Made `new` and `new.template` optional.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the `new.template` config.

    Use `template` instead.

### Fixed

- Fixed [a problem where `Cargo.lock` was not copied when running `new` command](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/issues/131).

## [0.8.3] - 2021-02-18Z

### Added

- cargo-compete now reads these environment variables if they exist, and use them. ([#129](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/129))

    - `$DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
    - `$YUKICODER_API_KEY`
    - `$CODEFORCES_API_KEY`
    - `$CODEFORCES_API_SECRET`

### Fixed

- Added `#[serde(default)]` to `PartialBatchTestCase::out: Option<Arc<str>>`. ([qryxip/snowchains/#128](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/128))

    Previously, explicit `out: ~` had been allowed but the field itself was required.

## [0.8.2] - 2021-02-15Z

### Added

- Added `Checker` variant to `Match`. ([qryxip/snowchains#124](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/124))

    ```yaml
    match:
      Checker:
        cmd: cat "$ACTUAL_OUTPUT" | cargo run --bin check-a
        shell: Bash
    ```

    ```yaml
    match:
      Checker:
        cmd: ~/.cache/online-judge-tools/library-checker-problems/math/sqrt_mod/checker "$INPUT" "$ACTUAL_OUTPUT" "$EXPECTED_OUTPUT"
        shell: Bash
    ```

## [0.8.1] - 2021-02-14Z

### Fixed

- Added a workaround for large process input/output. ([qryxip/snowchains#121](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/121))

- Fixed a problem where string values in YAMLs are unnecessarily quoted. ([qryxip/snowchains#121](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/121))

    This problem was caused by [a change](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/commit/ef990758a19d4d845cf19a8943e7d905909cafd8) in `serde-yaml v0.8.16`, which was released in February 2, 2021.

## [0.8.0] - 2021-01-24Z

### Added

- Added `add` command. ([#114](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/114))

    ```toml
    # for Library-Checker
    [add]
    url = "https://judge.yosupo.jp/problem/{{ args[0] }}"
    #is-contest = ["false"] # optional

        Saved 1 test case to /home/ryo/src/competitive/yukicoder/testcases/9001.yml
    ```

### Changed

- Made `package.metadata.cargo-compete.config` optional. ([#112](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/112))

    ```diff
    [package.metadata.cargo-compete]
    -config = "../compete.toml"
    ```

- Added new formats for `package.metadata.cargo-compete.bin`. ([#113](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/113))

    ```toml
    [package.metadata.cargo-compete.bin]
    practice-a = { alias = "a", problem = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/practice/tasks/practice_1" }
    practice-b = { alias = "b", problem = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/practice/tasks/practice_2" }
    ```

    ```toml
    [package.metadata.cargo-compete.bin]
    practice-a = { problem = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/practice/tasks/practice_1" }
    practice-b = { problem = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/practice/tasks/practice_2" }
    ```

    The old format is still valid.

### Fixed

- Fixed a problem about hyphen-separated contest IDs. ([#114](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/114))

## [0.7.1] - 2021-01-21Z

### Changed

- Improved around Dropbox. ([qryxip/snowchains#116](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/116))

### Fixed

- Fixed URL parsing for Codeforces. ([qryxip/snowchains#119](https://github.com/qryxip/snowchains/pull/119))
- The `init` command creates target paths. ([#105](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/105))
- Fixed a problem where generated package names are set to `"contest"` for Codeforces. ([#108](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/108) by [@tamuhey](https://github.com/tamuhey))

## [0.7.0] - 2021-01-16Z

### Added

- Added `bin_name` and `bin_alias` variables for `test-suite`. ([#96](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/96))

- Enabled `download`ing/`submit`ting with [online-judge-tools](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/oj). ([#98](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/98))

    `oj-api` in `$PATH` will be used if the domain of a problem URL is unknown.
    To use this new function, you need to install online-judge-tools first.

    ```toml
    [package.metadata.cargo-compete.bin]
    aplusb = { name = "aplusb", problem = "https://judge.yosupo.jp/problem/aplusb" }
    ```

### Changed

- Simplified `package.metadata.cargo-compete.bin.*.problem`. ([#96](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/96))

    - Removed `package.metadata.cargo-compete.bin.*.problem.{platform, contest, index}`.
    - URLs are now required.
    - The `problem = { url = ".." }` format is still supported.
    - `contest` in `test-suite` for yukicoder will be always `null`.

    ```diff
     [package.metadata.cargo-compete.bin]
    -a = { name = "arc110-a", problem = { platform = "atcoder", contest = "arc110", index = "A", url = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc110/tasks/arc110_a" } }
    -b = { name = "arc110-b", problem = { platform = "atcoder", contest = "arc110", index = "B", url = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc110/tasks/arc110_b" } }
    -c = { name = "arc110-c", problem = { platform = "atcoder", contest = "arc110", index = "C", url = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc110/tasks/arc110_c" } }
    -d = { name = "arc110-d", problem = { platform = "atcoder", contest = "arc110", index = "D", url = "https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc110/tasks/arc110_d" } }

    ```

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `problem` variable for `test-suite`. ([#96](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/96))

    Use `bin_alias` instead.

    ```toml
    # Path to the test file (Liquid template)
    #
    # Variables:
    #
    # - `manifest_dir`: Package directory
    # - `contest`:      Contest ID (e.g. "abc100")
    # - `bin_name`:     Name of a `bin` target (e.g. "abc100-a")
    # - `bin_alias`:    "Alias" for a `bin` target defined in `pacakge.metadata.cargo-compete` (e.g. "a")
    # - `problem`:      Alias for `bin_alias` (deprecated)
    #
    # Additional filters:
    #
    # - `kebabcase`: Convert to kebab case (by using the `heck` crate)
    test-suite = "{{ manifest_dir }}/testcases/{{ bin_alias }}.yml"
    ```

### Removed

- Removed the `migrate v04` command. ([#100](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/100))

- Removed the `submit.via-binary` configration. ([#100](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-compete/pull/100))

    Use [cargo-executable-payload](https://github.com/qryxip/cargo-executable-payload) instead.

    ```toml
    [submit.transpile]
    kind = "command"
    args = ["cargo", "executable-payload", "--bin", "{{ bin_name }}"]
    ```

## [0.6.5] - 2020-12-05Z

### Added

- Introduced [`serde_ignored` crate](https://docs.rs/serde_ignored).

    As Cargo does, cargo-compete warns for unused keys in `compete.toml` and in `package.metadata`.

    ```console
    ❯ cargo compete o
    warning: unused key in compete.toml: oepn
    ```

- [`test`, `submit`] Added `test.profile` option.

    Now you can test your programs with release mode by default.

    ```toml
    [new.template]
    profile = '''
    [release]
    debug-assertions = true
    overflow-checks = true
    '''

    # ...

    [test]
    # Profile for `cargo build`. ("dev" | "release")
    #
    # Defaults to `"dev"`.
    profile = "release"
    ```

    [Profiles - The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html)

## [0.6.4] - 2020-11-24Z

### Added

- [`new`] Added `new.template.profile`.

    ```toml
    [new.template]
    lockfile = "./template-cargo-lock.toml"
    # `profile` for `Cargo.toml`.
    #
    # By setting this, you can run tests with `opt-level=3` while enabling `debug-assertions` and `overflow-checks`.
    profile = '''
    [dev]
    opt-level = 3
    '''
    ```

    [Profiles - The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html)

### Fixed
